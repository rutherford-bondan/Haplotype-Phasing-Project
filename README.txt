Class Project
Audrey Magsig & Austin Bond

Project:
Imputing genotype data using mode-based approach and phasing into haplotypes using Clark's Algorithm

Instructions to run:
Requires no user input/arguments
Run in RStudio or command line
Assumes test_data_masked.txt is in your working directory, will read in that file, run our imputation and phasing and then write out test_data_sol.txt to the working directory as well. An error may be printed if not all of the dataset was successfully phased, however, that is not expected to be the case.
